## Introduction

Artificial intelligence has the power to create vast amounts of content, but with this power comes the risk of spreading misinformation and fabricating data. **Antiai** is a tool that addresses this issue by utilizing basic mathematical equations to produce scripts that are both powerful and truthful. The goal is to provide a reliable alternative to AI-generated content, ensuring that the information generated is rooted in clear and understandable logic.

## Features

- **Script Generation**: Create extensive and complex scripts using only simple mathematical formulas.
- **Transparency**: Every output is derived from clear, traceable mathematical operations, minimizing the risk of deceptive or biased content.
- **Simplicity**: No need for complex algorithms or machine learning models. Antiai operates on fundamental math principles.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the underlying equations to suit specific needs or applications.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to and modify the project to expand its capabilities.

## Installation

To get started with **Antiai**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/antiai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd antiai
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Using **Antiai** is simple. You can start generating scripts by providing basic mathematical equations as input.

Example command:
```bash
python antiai.py "equation1" "equation2" "equation3"
```

This will generate a script based on the input equations, ensuring each step is transparent and easy to follow.

### Command Line Options

- `-o`, `--output`: Specify the output file name for the generated script.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose mode to see detailed logs of the script generation process.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use **Antiai**:

### Example 1: Basic Arithmetic

```bash
python antiai.py "2 + 2" "5 * 3" "10 / 2"
```

### Example 2: More Complex Equations

```bash
python antiai.py "x = 3" "y = 2 * x + 5" "z = y^2 - 4"
```

These examples demonstrate how **Antiai** can take simple equations and produce a coherent and logically sound script.
